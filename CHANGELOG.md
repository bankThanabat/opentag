# Changelog

## v0.3.0 - 2026-06-30

OpenTag 0.3.0 improves the local CLI setup path and makes source-thread
approvals clearer in Slack and GitHub.

### Added

- Slack source-thread action buttons for `apply`, `approve`, `reject`, and
  `continue`
- Slack Events API and Socket Mode handling for interactive Block Kit actions
- Slack source-message receipt reactions with a text acknowledgement fallback
- Custom executor command support in CLI setup and local runtime config
- Structured executor report parsing for Codex and Claude Code summaries
- GitHub suggested-action rendering with clearer action details and verification
  rows
- Real Slack UI trigger dogfood script for live end-to-end validation

### Changed

- Slack final callbacks are quieter and keep internal proposal metadata out of
  the main thread
- GitHub and Slack action decisions now route through the same source-thread
  action path as typed commands
- Executor summaries avoid presenting source-control handoff steps as manual
  user blockers
- `opentag doctor` catches deprecated Codex model tiers
- Public README setup flow now points users at the published CLI first

### Fixed

- Common repository-edit requests for extensionless files such as `Dockerfile`
  and `Makefile` receive the right local write scope
- GitHub suggested-action details keep summary-only verification rows visible
- Slack receipt delivery is bounded without silently losing acknowledgement
  fallback behavior
